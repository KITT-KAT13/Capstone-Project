        <h1>What is space?</h1>
        Space, or "outer space," is the nearly empty, three-dimensional expanse beyond Earth's atmosphere where celestial bodies
        like planets and stars are located. It is a boundless region characterized by extremely low pressure and temperature,
        containing matter, energy, radiation, magnetic fields, and the fundamental forces that shape the universe. For Earth,
        it's defined as the area beginning at the Kármán Line (about 100 kilometers or 62 miles above sea level), where the
        atmosphere thins out and stops scattering light.
